      "I don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, \"\"commissars\"\"?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of User_talk:AuburnPilot under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.\n",

      "In the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.\n",
      "\n",
      "BTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.\n",

      "As for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.\n",

If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?\n",

(And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.)

      "\n",
      "One of the main rights of humans, as well as countries is the right to freely choose its name.  One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by User:Makedonas, User:Nestore and User:Vergina because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by User:Makedonas: This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. \n",
      "For me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.\n",
      " History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.\n",
      " Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!\n",
      " One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.\n",
      " Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.\n",
      " Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.\n",

They also show techniques to deal with parties sometimes being reported and sometimes not, and sometimes being reported together. There is no need for the opinion polling table to be so abbreviated. Thus, we should reflect what the citations say. If polls are released that lump everyone other than the four biggest parties as \"\"other\"\", that's fine  we report \"\"other\"\". If polls are released that give results for the Greens, BNP etc., then we should report those. We should be doing our best to avoid a situation where we are in danger of original research: I understand the 'cliff edge' argument, but that approach should be a last resort. We should take our lead from reliable sources, as always.\n",
